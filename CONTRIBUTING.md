## Code quality expectations

* C++20, portable where practical, Windows/MSVC first.
* All first-party code compiles with zero warnings. MSVC builds use
  `/W4 /WX /permissive-`. Do not silence a warning to make a build
  green; fix the cause or narrow the suppression with a comment explaining
  why it is correct.
* No new third-party runtime dependency may be introduced without an
  explicit decision recorded in the change description. The runtime is
  deliberately dependency-light.
* Physical quantities use exact integer units with explicit unit types.
  Floating point must not be used as an authority or accounting boundary.
* Missing, stale, unavailable, denied, indeterminate, and zero are distinct
  states. Do not encode any of them as another.
* Every authority-bearing mutation must carry the identity it was planned
  against (incident, generation, control epoch, incarnation, state
  revision) and must be refused deterministically when that identity is
  stale, future, or superseded.

## Building and testing

The canonical build, test, install, and package-consumption commands are
documented in `README.md`. In short:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Tests are proof obligations rather than decoration. A change that alters
emergency semantics should come with a test that would fail if the
semantics regressed, including illegal-transition and stale-evidence cases
where they apply. Tests must not depend on timeouts or wall-clock sleeps.

## Review checklist

* Does the change preserve the owned boundary described in `README.md`?
  Actuating physical equipment, scheduling workloads, and owning cooling
  failover are explicitly out of scope.
* Are all new inputs bounded, and are declared sizes checked before
  allocation?
* Is every new persisted field integrity-checked and strictly decoded,
  including reserved fields and trailing bytes?
* Are new public results expressed as status codes rather than exception
  text?
* Is anything under a lock that can call back into user or adapter code?
